      <description>Hi&amp;hellip; Let me introduce myself&amp;hellip;
I&#39;m Diego Sabolo, from Argentina, father of Sof√≠a and husband of Anabella. My work is about creating software pieces that help organizations to achieve their objectives. I have a University Degree in TI from the Buenos Aires University. Been focused in Drupal since 2007 I worked in projects for several companies such as Disney, Parrot, Glamour Magazine, Nestle, and others.
I mostly creates web apps (from the classic era: Drupal, Wordpress, Laravel and new approaches like JAM Stack), but not just that.</description>

## Hello, I'm Diego Sabolo, a software developer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

### Welcome to my blog, where I aim to share my journey and insights gained through years of experience in the world of software development. With a focus on  Backend Development (PHP, Drupal, Node), FrontEnd Development (javascript, react, vue), methodologies, and more, I strive to provide valuable notes and lessons learned along the way.
